## About the Project

My target is to build a usable Restaurant web-application allowing owners to dynamically and easily edit content.
The Homepage includes Header/Banner section with dynamic Title and Subtitle,
Fast order section with dynamic product showcase selection,
Info and about sections with dynamic content sections.



## Stack

The application is build on pure HTML/CSS for the static part and using PHP's Framework - Laravel for the back-end connection.
The communication between the database and the front-end is achieved trough MySql.

Also for the Homepage several Javascript plugins are used including:
